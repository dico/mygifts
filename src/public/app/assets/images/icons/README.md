# App Icons

To complete the iOS PWA setup, you need to create the following icon files:

## Required Icons

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## How to Create Icons

### Option 1: Use Figma/Sketch/Adobe XD
1. Create a 512x512px artboard
2. Design your app icon (gift emoji or custom design)
3. Export as PNG at 512x512
4. Use an image resizer to create the 192x192 version

### Option 2: Use Online Tools
- https://www.appicon.co/ - Upload one large image and it generates all sizes
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/ - Comprehensive favicon and app icon generator

### Option 3: Simple Placeholder (Quick Start)
You can temporarily use the gift emoji as an icon:
1. Go to https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/wrapped-gift/
2. Download the generated icons
3. Rename them to match the required filenames

## Design Guidelines

For best results on iOS:
- Use a simple, recognizable design
- Avoid text (it becomes unreadable at small sizes)
- Use a solid background color
- Center your main icon element
- Leave a small margin around edges
- iOS will automatically round corners and add the gloss effect

## Recommended Design

Since your app is "MyGifts", a simple wrapped gift icon with your brand colors would work well:
- Background: Light blue (#007aff) or white
- Icon: Gift box emoji or custom gift illustration
- Keep it minimal and clean
